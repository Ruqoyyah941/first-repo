    the push() method adds elements to the end of an array, and unshift() adds elements to the beginning.
    pop() removes an element from the end of an array, while shift() removes an element from the beginning. 
    The key difference between pop() and shift() and their cousins push() and unshift(), is that neither method takes parameters, 
    and each only allows an array to be modified by a single element at a time.
    splice() allows us to do just that: remove any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array.

    splice() can take up to 3 parameters, but for now, we'll focus on just the first 2. The first two parameters of splice() are integers
    which represent indexes, or positions, of the array that splice() is being called upon. And remember, arrays are zero-indexed, so to
    indicate the first element of an array, we would use 0. splice()'s first parameter represents the index on the array from which to 
    begin removing elements, while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete. For example:
    
    let array = ['today', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'great'];
    
    array.splice(2, 2);
    Here we remove 2 elements, beginning with the third element (at index 2). array would have the value ['today', 'was', 'great'].
    
    splice() not only modifies the array it's being called on, but it also returns a new array containing the value of the removed elements:
    
    
    
    slice() copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it is called upon untouched. slice() takes only 2 parameters â€” the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction (extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index). Consider this:

let weatherConditions = ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'];

let todaysWeather = weatherConditions.slice(1, 3);
todaysWeather would have the value ['snow', 'sleet'], while weatherConditions would still have ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'].


While slice() allows us to be selective about what elements of an array to copy, among several other useful tasks, ES6's new spread operator allows us to easily copy all of an array's elements, in order, with a simple and highly readable syntax. The spread syntax simply looks like this: ...

In practice, we can use the spread operator to copy an array like so:

let thisArray = [true, true, undefined, false, null];
let thatArray = [...thisArray];
thatArray equals [true, true, undefined, false, null]. thisArray remains unchanged and thatArray contains the same elements as thisArray.



Another huge advantage of the spread operator is the ability to combine arrays, or to insert all the elements of one array into another, at any index. With more traditional syntaxes, we can concatenate arrays, but this only allows us to combine arrays at the end of one, and at the start of another. Spread syntax makes the following operation extremely simple:

let thisArray = ['sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme'];

let thatArray = ['basil', 'cilantro', ...thisArray, 'coriander'];
thatArray would have the value ['basil', 'cilantro', 'sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme', 'coriander'].

Using spread syntax, we have just achieved an operation that would have been more complex and more verbose had we used traditional methods.

<p>Example: We have defined a function spreadOut that returns the variable sentence. Modify the function using the spread operator so that it returns the array ['learning', 'to', 'code', 'is', 'fun'].
    Answer: function spreadOut() {
        let fragment = ['to', 'code'];
        let sentence = ['learning', ...fragment, 'is', 'fun']; // Change this line
        return sentence;
      }
      
      console.log(spreadOut());
